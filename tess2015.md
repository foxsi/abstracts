Abstract
========
Energy release and particle acceleration on the Sun is a frequent occurrence associated with a number of different
solar phenomenon including but not limited to solar flares and coronal mass ejections. The exact mechanism through
which particle are accelerated is still not well understood. One of the best ways to gain insight into accelerated
particles on the Sun is by observing the Sun in hard X-rays (HXR) which provide one of the most direct diagnostics of
energetic electrons. Past and current HXR observations lack the sensitivity and dynamic range necessary to observe
the faint signature of accelerated electrons where they are accelerated in the solar corona. However these limitatio
ns can be overcome through the use of HXR focusing optics coupled with solid-state pixelated detectors. We present on
the second successful launch of the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager, a sounding rocket payload which flew on
December 11, 2014. In this flight, the FOXSI optics were upgraded for better sensitivity and new CdTe strip detectors
were included to provide increased detection efficiency. During this flight, FOXSI observed thermal emission from at
least three active regions (AR#12234, AR#12233, AR#12235). Another observation target for FOXSI was the quiet Sun. In
this presentation we summarize the flight as well as the latest observations and analysis.
