Abstract
========
Energy release and particle acceleration on the Sun is a frequent occurrence associated with a number of different
solar phenomenon including but not limited to solar flares, coronal mass ejections and nanoflares. The exact
mechanism through which particles are accelerated and energy is released is still not well understood. This issue
is related to the unsolved coronal heating problem, the mystery of the heating mechanism for the
million degree solar corona. One prevalent theory posits the existence of a multitude of small flares, dubbed
nanoflares. Recent observations of active region AR11890 by IRIS (Testa et al. 2014) are consistent with numerical
simulations of heating by impulsive beams of nonthermal electrons, suggesting that nanoflares may be similar to large
flares in that they accelerate particles.  Furthermore, observations by the EUNIS sounding rocket (Brosius et al.
2014) of faint Fe XIX (592.2 Angstrom) emission in an active region is indicative of plasma at temperatures of at
least 8.9 MK providing further evidence of nanoflare heating. One of the best ways to gain insight into accelerated
particles on the Sun and the presence of hot plasma is by observing the Sun in hard X-rays (HXR). We present on
observations taken during the second successful flight of the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI-2). FOXSI
flew on December 11, 2014 with upgraded optics as well as new CdTe strip detectors. FOXSI-2 observed thermal emission
(4-15 keV) from at least three active regions (AR#12234, AR#12233, AR#12235) and observed regions of the Sun without
active regions. We present on using FOXSI observations to test the presence of hot temperatures in and outside of active regions.
