Abstract
========
Energy release and particle acceleration on the Sun is a frequent occurrence associated with a number of different
solar phenomenon including but not limited to solar flares and coronal mass ejections. The exact mechanism through
which particle are accelerated is still not well understood. One of the best ways to gain insight into accelerated
particles on the Sun is by observing the Sun in hard X-rays (HXR) which provide one of the most direct diagnostics of
energetic electrons. Past and current HXR observations lack the sensitivity and dynamic range necessary to observe
the faint signature of accelerated electrons where they are accelerated in the solar corona. However these 
limitations can be overcome through the use of HXR focusing optics coupled with solid-state pixelated detectors. We
present on observations taken during the second successful flight of the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI-2). FOXSI flew on December 11, 2014 with upgraded optics as well as new CdTe strip detectors. FOXSI-2 observed thermal
emission (4-15 keV) from at least three active regions (AR#12234, AR#12233, AR#12235) and observed regions of the Sun without active regions. We present on using FOXSI observations to constrain active region differential emission measure. We also provide a measurement of the limit on quiet Sun emission.
